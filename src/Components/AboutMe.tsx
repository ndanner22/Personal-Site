          lifecycle and strengthened my ability to adapt to new technologies
          quickly. As a full-stack developer, I strive to bridge the gap between
          design and technology, ensuring that every application I create is not
          only functional but also user-friendly. I am excited to continue my
          journey in the tech industry, leveraging my expertise to contribute to
